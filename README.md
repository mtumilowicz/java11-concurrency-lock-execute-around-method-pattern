# java11-concurrency-lock-execute-around-method-pattern
Example of Execute Around Method pattern.

# preface
For details about `ReadWriteLock` please refer my other
github project: https://github.com/mtumilowicz/java-concurrency-readwritelock

In this project we will show how to use Execute Around Method 
(EAM) pattern to wrap critical sections and minimise the pain
of working with the `ReadWriteLock` interface.
